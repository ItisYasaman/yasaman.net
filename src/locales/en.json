My longer works primarily fall within the genres of fantasy and magical realism, while most of my shorter pieces are rooted in fiction. Some of my favorite authors are Darren Shan, Abbas Maroufi, Haruki Murakami, and many other talented writers whose remarkable works I've had the pleasure of discovering.
