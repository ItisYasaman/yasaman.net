Though I stretch my education as far as it will go, it intertwines neither with literature nor with the arts. Writing has been my constant companion for as long as memory serves, even before the mastery of reading and writing graced my fingertips. My journey began with tragedy, meandered through the realms of fantasy, and after crafting an extensive fantasy saga, I found myself drawn to the whispers of reality, eager to explore its depths."
